This is for practicing Git-Hub flow
I chose the computer science major because I want to go into the federal side of law enforcement and things like computer science and cyber security will help me greatly in this field. I am hoping to get a better understanding of the team building and cooporative side of creating a software as we have not gotten to dwell into this side as much.
